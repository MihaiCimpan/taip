Application developing
======================

Client-server architecture using the HTTP stack by implementing a web UI and a specialized API for integration with other services.


Server-side
-----------

- a specialized backend language such as Java, Python, Nodejs, etc
- a database engine for data persistance - MongoDB or PostgreSQL (
- a distributed architecture for efficient processing of data (such as parameter generation, validation, various computations, etc).

Client-side
-----------

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- specific frameworks: Bootstrap
